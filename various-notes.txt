[REINSTALL ARCH FROM PACKAGE LIST]

[TTY FONT (arch)]
/etc/vconsole.conf ::
FONT=ter-16n

/etc/mkinitcpio.conf
#place "consolefont" after the base hook

# Reinstall or regenerate the kernel image


[RANGER]
##To add icon support
Install NerdFonts
git clone https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons ~/.config/ranger/plugins/ranger_devicons
(remove .git directory etc if you are using git on your .config folder)
(you only need the __init__.py and devicons.py files)
"default_linemode devicons" in rc.conf
Install "ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols" on ArchLinux

[NAUTILUS]
## Nautilus doesn't open gedit as a text editor
Set "DBusActivatable=false" in /usr/share/applications/org.gnome.gedit.desktop
## Use SMB by writing smb://server/folder (arch)
Install "gvfs-smb" and it will work out of the box

##SET GTK 3 THEME
~/user/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini::

[Settings]
gtk-icon-theme-name = Arc
gtk-theme-name = Arc-Dark
gtk-font-name = Liberation Sans 12


##SYSTEMD-NETWORKD
#Simple wired connection for a desktop tower:

/etc/systemd/network/wired.network ::

/etc/resolv.conf ::
#Google public DNS server

systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd


[SYNOLOGY NAS USING SAMBA]
#Install "samba" (archlinux)
#Configure the nas from the web interface: user, pass, folder, permissions etc..
#Start the service with 
$ systemctl enable now samba.service

#Create a credentials file (e.g .smbServer) in which you write::
username=john
password=doe1234
#Referring to the user on the NAS
#Chmod and chown it for safety, and place it somewhere safe (e.g. the root's home)

#Add a line like this in the /etc/fstab::
//192.168.1.100/CONDIVISA   /mnt/nas    cifs    nofail,credentials=/root/.smbServer,uid=1000    0 0
# {//<nas-ip>/folder}     {mount point}  {fs type}      {options, see below}                  {pass dump}

# CIFS is the old name for the SMB implementation for UNIX
# nofail: the system won't panic if it can't connect to the drive, usefull for a laptop
# credentials=/path/to/creds-file: Path to the credentials file
# uid=1000: The uid of your user in the local machine that connects the NAS

#or
//192.168.1.100/CONDIVISA   /mnt/nas    cifs    nofail,guest,uid=1000    0 0
//nas/CONDIVISA				/mnt/nas	cifs	nofail,guest,uid=1000	0 0
#if you want to use it as guest.
#You can also use a Windows UNC style server name instead of the IP.
#As you might think, it's better to give the NAS a static local IP.
#Reboot and you are done.

#or even
sudo mount.cifs //nas/CONDIVISA /mnt/nas -o uid=1000,guest
# for a quick, windows-like \\name connection

[APPLE KEYBOARD TWEAKS]
## If you use an iso apple keyboard, <,> have changed place with ^,Â°  @,#  `,~
## Do this as root to fix it and regenerate the initramfs:
echo "0" > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/iso_layout
echo "options hid_apple iso_layout=0" >> /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf

## To convert the f13,f14,f15 keys to SysRQ,SLk,Pause and remove the navigation
## layer in the keypad (NumLock/Clear won't do anything):
xkb_options "apple:alupckeys,numpad:mac"

## To use F<num> keys as regular PC keys instead of media keys
echo 2 >> /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
echo "options hid_apple fnmode=2" >> /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf
